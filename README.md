2. Place the boilerplate app folder into the `/htdocs` directory of your XAMPP installation.
3. Start the XAMPP control panel and enable **Apache** and **MySQL**.
4. Configure your `.env` file as described below.
5. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost/[folder-name]`.

## üîë OAuth Configuration
The boilerplate app uses the Openticket OAuth, so you'll need to create a new client.
1. Navigate to the **Dashboard**.
2. Create a new OAuth client.
   - Use the URL you plan to use, such as `http://localhost/openticket-boilerplate` or your live domain.
3. Note down the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** provided by your OAuth provider.
4. Open the `.env` file in the boilerplate directory and update the following:
   ```env
   OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
   OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
   OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI=http://your-url-here
   ```
5. Save the changes. You should now be able to access your app, log in, and see the example pages.

## üìÑ Adding Pages
Adding pages to your app is simple:
1. Create a new `.php` file in the `/pages` directory.
2. The file name will automatically be added to the menu (underscores `_` will be replaced with spaces).

For example, if you create a file called `new_feature.php`, it will appear in the menu as `New feature`.

This boilerplate comes with 4 example pages you can copy and modify to suit your needs.
